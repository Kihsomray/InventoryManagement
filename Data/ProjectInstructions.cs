Proposal

Please upload your project proposal. Refer to the template on the course main page.
 The proposal must include the following:

1. The description of the database application.
2. The data to be stored in the database. You must explicitly specify all the entities (around 15-20 entities) and attributes that your application will contain
3. Typical scenarios and functionalities that you will implement (7 typical scenarios)
4. Analytical queries that deeply dive and analyze the data to retrieve interesting information (5 queries)
5. Business logic that is specific to the application you are developing



Intermediate Deliverable
Based on proposed application, you need to submit the following three deliverable:

ER Design
Based on your application, produce an ER design.Submit a file called lname_fname_ER.pdf

Schema Design
Start with the ER design, generate the tables and (if needed) recursively decompose the tables into BCNF and 4NF. Identify all non-trivial MVD and FD's. Submit a file called lname_fname_normalized.pdf

SQL Script
Based upon your ER Design, write a SQL script that generates the proposed database in SQL Server/MySQL.  Note that your data types and constraints may vary based on the specific DBMS, but otherwise, there should be a direct 1 to 1 relationship between the diagram and the SQL script.  Include in your SQL script the following:

A NOT COMMENTED OUT CREATE DATABASE statement, name your database "lname_fname_db"
SQL commands for CREATE TABLE
Foreign keys and referential integrity actions
Any other constraints necessary in the CREATE TABLE statements
SQL commands to enter data into the table.
 Queries that retrieve data from the database. These queries should implement the 7 scenarios and 5 analytical queries that were described in the project proposal 
Name the SQL Script as  lname_fname_queries.sql



Final Deliverable
In this part of the project,
This submission adds the UI part on top of whatever you have implemented for the intermediate project submission.
What to submit:

1. lname_fname_Queries.sql that contain all SQL queries (from previous part of this project)
2. Well documented source code for the UI that connects to the database.
3. A well written readme which explains how to install/run the code.
